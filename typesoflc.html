    <h1> Types of Letter of Credit (LC) </h1>

    <p>
        There are three basic features of letters of credit, each of which has two options. These are described below.
        Each letter of credit has a combination of each of the three features.
    </p>

    <h2>Sight or Term/Usance</h2>

    <p>Letters of credit can permit the beneficiary to be paid immediately upon presentation of specified documents
        (sight letter of credit), or at a future date as established in the sales contract (term/usance letter of
        credit).
    </p>

    <h2>Irrevocable</h2>

    <p>
        As per ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) Letters of credit can not be revocable. This means that they
        cannot be cancelled or amended at any time by the issuing bank without notice to the beneficiary. An irrevocable
        letter of credit cannot be cancelled without
        the consent of the beneficiary.
    </p>

    <h2>Unconfirmed or Confirmed</h2>

    <p>An unconfirmed letter of credit carries the obligation of the issuing bank to honour all drawings, provided that
        the terms and conditions of the letter of credit have been complied with. A confirmed letter of credit also
        carries the obligation of another bank which is normally located in the beneficiary’s country, thereby giving
        the beneficiary the comfort of dealing with a bank known to him.
        <br/> In addition to these basic types, there are various specialized formats which meet particular
        sets of circumstances.
    </p>

    <h2>Red Clause Letter of Credit</h2>

    <p>A red clause letter of credit incorporates a clause, traditionally written in red, which
        authorizes the bank acting as the negotiating or paying bank to pay the beneficiary in advance
        of shipment. This enables the purchase and accumulation of goods from a number of different
        suppliers, and the arrangement of shipment in accordance with the letter of credit terms. Such
        advances will be deducted from the amount due to be paid when the documents called for are
        presented under the letter of credit. If the beneficiary fails to ship the goods or cannot do so
        before the expiry of the letter of credit, the issuing bank is bound to reimburse the negotiating
        or paying bank, recovering its payment from the applicant.
    </p>

    <h2>Transferable Letter of Credit</h2>

    <p>A transferable letter of credit allows the beneficiary to act as a middleman and transfer his
        rights under a letter of credit to another party or parties who may be suppliers of the goods.
        Depending on whether the letter of credit permits partial shipments, fractional amounts may
        be transferred to more than one beneficiary. The letter of credit however, can be transferred
        only once: the secondary beneficiaries cannot transfer their rights to a third party. Transfer of
        a letter of credit can be made on specific application by the original beneficiary to the
        authorized transferring bank
        <br/>To be transferable, a letter of credit must be so marked by the issuing bank which can only do
        so on the applicant’s specific instructions. The applicant should be aware that any second
        beneficiary, the probable supplier, is usually a party not likely known to the applicant
    </p>

    <h2>Back-to-Back Letter of Credit</h2>

    <p>Back to Back Letter of Credit is essentially a secondary or ancillary credit opened by a bank
        on behalf of the beneficiary of the original credit in favor of a supplier located inside or
        outside the original beneficiary’s country. The bank may open Back to Back L/C against
        export L/C (Master L/C) received by export oriented industrial unit operating under the
        bonded warehouse system subject to observation of domestic value addition requirement
        (stated in term of permissible limit of CFR value of imported input as percentage of FOB
        export value of output) prescribed by the ministry of a commerce from time to time.
    </p>

    <h2>Deferred Payment Letter of Credit</h2>

    <p>Under a deferred payment letter of credit, the applicant does not pay until a future date
        determined in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. No drafts are called for, which
        avoids “stamp duties” charged by some countries on bills of exchange (drafts). One reason an
        exporter might extend credit terms to an importer could be the competitiveness of the market
        and the need for the exporter to finance the importer if the exporter is to make the sale.
    </p>

    <h2>Standby Letters of Credit</h2>

    <p>Standby letters of credit may apply in general to transactions which are based on the concept
        of default by the applicant in performance of a contract or obligation. In the event of default,
        the beneficiary is permitted to draw under the letter of credit. Standby letters of credit may be
        used as a substitute for performance guarantees, or issued to guarantee loans granted by one
        firm to another, thereby securing payment to the creditor in the event the other party fails to
        repay its obligation on the due date. Even if the applicant claims to have performed, the bank
        issuing the letter of credit is obliged to make payment provided the beneficiary produces
        complying documents, usually a sight draft, and a written demand for payment.</p>
