    <h1>Definition of Import Letter of Credit (LC)</h1>

    <p>
        Import Letter of credit is a definite undertaking by the importer’s bank that if the exporter exports the goods
        and produces documents as stipulated in the letter of credit, the bank would make payment to the exporter. Thus
        the obligation of the importer under the contract is supplemented by a superior obligation of a bank to make
        payment. As per UCP 600:

        </br> “Credit means any arrangement, however named or described, that is irrevocable and thereby constitutes a
        definite undertaking of the issuing bank to honour a complying presentation.

        </br> Honour means:

        </br> a. to pay at sight if the credit is available by sight payment.

        </br> b. to incur a deferred payment undertaking and pay at maturity if the credit is available by deferred
        payment.

        </br> c. to accept a bill of exchange (“draft”) drawn by the beneficiary and pay at maturity if the credit is
        available by acceptance.”


        </br> Issuing bank means the bank that issues a credit at the request of an applicant or on its own behalf.

        </br>An issuing bank should discourage any attempt by the applicant to include, as an
        integral part of the credit, copies of the underlying contract, proforma invoice and the
        like.
